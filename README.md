### Running the program 
To run the disassembler, open the program in Visual Studio. In order to compile all the files run: 
```
make all
```
After our files have compiled, upload a .obj file or use one of the files in the test_cases and run the following command: 
```
./lc4 outfilename.txt example1.obj example2.obj
```
The example .obj files will be replaced with the name of your .obj files and you can include 1 to how ever many files you desire. The output .asm file will then be in the outputfilename.asm file generated.
